# PrisonersDilemmaTournamentTools
This repo contains tools and example code written by CaryKH, Edward Haas, and various contributers to https://github.com/Prisoners-Dilemma-Enjoyers/PrisonersDilemmaTournament

## Usage
You can run the tournament using

> run.py

This will create a cache file `cache.json` which can be used with the other tools for analysis. The cache file also makes subsequent runs of `run.py` significantly faster. You can have `run.py` ignore the cache file using the flag `--delete-cache`.
